2.Here the left image depicts the UI element of Consumer side.There are various options for the easiness of the usage and also afastlane fo browsing of the nearest and feasible solutions.
The right image is of the UI of the seller side and depicts a very interactive interface with only two easy to use options for the seller.The first depicts the loading of their ads and second is for the posting

# Technical stack

1. Usage of android studio to build the app with <b>java
    and XML</b> as backend.
2. <b>Keras library with Tensorflow</b> backend for the creation
    of deep learning model to identify the type of vegetables.
3. Server side: <b>PHP along with SQL</b> type databasehosted
    on a free server (000webhost powered Hostinger).
4. <b>Geocoding and reverse-Geocoding</b> to identify the location
    automatically. 
5. Python Scripting on Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
    for the model to be trained. And integration of the <b>.tflite</b> file 
    which reduces the size of AI model and hence the app.
6. The use of <b>firebase for the Authentication for OTP</b> and notification sending activity along with
    <b>Google Maps API</b> for geocoding
